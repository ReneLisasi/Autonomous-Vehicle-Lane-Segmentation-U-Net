Abstract—The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, part of the United States Department of Transportation issued a Standing General Order requiring identified manufacturers and operators to report to the agency certain crashes involving vehicles equipped with automated driving or advanced driver assistance systems. Since 2021, 4303 crashes have been reported with an average of 200 in May 2025 alone, resulting in loss of consumer trust.  This study attempts to improve on current state of the art lane segmentation to reduce accidents further and increase customer trust by focusing on an important facet of autonomous driving, lane segmentation using advanced deep learning architectures.
